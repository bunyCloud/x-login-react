# Node.js Express Authentication Server

This README provides an overview of a Node.js Express server designed for handling authentication, with session management and MongoDB as a database for storing user information. It showcases integration with Passport.js for authentication strategies and cookie sessions for session management.

## Features

- **Express Server**: Utilizes Express.js for the server framework, enabling efficient handling of HTTP requests.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Connects to MongoDB using Mongoose for storing and managing user data.
- **Passport.js Authentication**: Implements Passport.js for handling user authentication.
- **Cookie Session Management**: Uses cookie sessions to manage user sessions securely.
- **CORS Enabled**: Configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from specified origins.
- **Authentication Routes**: Includes a set of routes under `/auth` for handling authentication processes.

## Dependencies

- `express`: Web framework for Node.js.
- `cookie-session`: Middleware for session management using cookies.
- `passport`: Middleware for authenticating users.
- `express-session`: Session middleware for Express.
- `mongoose`: MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- `cors`: Middleware to enable CORS with various options.
- `cookie-parser`: Middleware to parse cookie header and populate `req.cookies` with an object keyed by cookie names.

## Configuration

Before running the server, ensure you have the following configurations set in `./config/keys.js`:

- `MONGODB_URI`: Your MongoDB connection string.
- `COOKIE_KEY`: A secret key used to sign the session cookie.

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node [your-server-file-name].js
